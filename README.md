The client Artemis Financial , a company who creates personal financial plans, wanted us to fix any software security concerns that could be found along with updating their software to keep their clients data and financial information safe. While I was unable to make it to most of the actual assignments I have learn a good bit by going through and reading the reading material while at work. The importance of coding securly comes in the form of data protection. Learning how to use the maven plug in to create vulnerability assessments was vital in what portions of the course I was able to attempt.
